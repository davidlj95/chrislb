  "quote": "Creative imaginary based on the analysis of the central nervous system’s morphology.",
  "description": "This innovative concept delves deep into the intricacies of the nervous system, focusing on three fundamental aspects: neuron morphology, the intricate process of synapsis, and the complex web of intercellular communication. This exploration is ingeniously embodied in the design of a reversible jacket, where each layer serves a distinct purpose. The outer layer of the jacket functions as a protective shield, safeguarding the delicate neural network from external influences. Its symbolic representation of electrical impulses running through the brain highlights the formation of vital neural connections.\n\nConversely, the inner layer offers a unique window into the intricate process of neural connections, providing a visual narrative of the cognitive processes that underpin our understanding of the world. Crafted from organic silk for a touch of natural elegance and featuring thick padding for structural integrity, this concept seamlessly combines aesthetic appeal with practical utility. In doing so, it offers a compelling and multifaceted representation of the complexity of the human nervous system.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
