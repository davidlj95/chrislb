  "description": "The project delves into a pivotal moment in human evolutionary history when our ancestors transitioned from marine life to land-dwelling beings. Despite this shift, our enduring connection with the ocean remains at the core of this concept. This exploration centers on the foliate sea dragon, a seahorse species, to celebrate its structure, form, and colours. The concept intricately weaves together various materials such as leather, printed neoprene, and silk georgette to craft a dress that embodies the essence of this unique marine creature. By highlighting the foliate sea dragon, the project aims to rekindle our awareness of the profound ties binding us to the underwater world.\n\nThe choice of materials mirrors the diversity of the oceanic environment, symbolizing the resilience of leather, the vibrancy of printed neoprene, and the elegance of silk georgette. This concept not only pays homage to our aquatic origins but also serves as a poignant artistic statement, prompting reflection on the enduring connection between human life and the sea.\n"
