  "description": "Millions of years in the past, our human ancestors embarked on a transformative journey, transitioning from life within the marine ecosystem to becoming terrestrial beings. This evolutionary shift severed the immediate ties between humanity and the aquatic world, yet the profound connection that still lingers between our species and the ocean remains central to this concept. \"Return to the Origins of the Sea\" places a spotlight on the remarkable foliate sea dragon, a seahorse species, in a captivating exploration of structure, form, and colour. This concept weaves together an eclectic fusion of materials, employing leather, printed neoprene, and silk georgette to fashion a dress that encapsulates the essence of this unique marine creature.\n\nBy drawing attention to the foliate sea dragon, this concept seeks to rekindle our awareness of the intricate relationships that bind us to the world beneath the waves. The choice of materials mirrors the diversity of the oceanic environment, merging the resilience of leather, the vibrancy of printed neoprene, and the elegance of silk georgette. In doing so, it not only pays tribute to the aquatic origins of our species but also serves as a compelling artistic statement that encourages us to contemplate the ever-persistent connection between human life and the sea.\n"
